# Homework2
This project is deployed at https://wgobrie1.github.io/Homework2/Portfolio.html

This is the second homework assignment, Advanced CSS homework.

This assignment is designed to be a portfolio to show to a potential employer.

This preliminary mock-up will be updated in the future, when projects can be added to the portfolio, and work can be shown to prove my own ability for the future.

This website is currently essentially a frame of a portfolio site for the future, as everything is essentially just placeholder images, linked to google.com.
